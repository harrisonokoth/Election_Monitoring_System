Election Integrity App
Project Summary
The Election Integrity App is a Django-based web application aimed at improving election transparency and monitoring irregularities during electoral processes. The app empowers citizens to report any issues they observe during elections, ensuring a robust system for identifying and addressing potential voter suppression, fraud, and other irregularities.

This application offers a platform where election reports can be logged, tracked, and reviewed by both authorities and the public to ensure the integrity of democratic processes.

Features
Report Submission: Citizens can submit reports on election-related issues, such as voter suppression, tampering, or fraud. Reports include relevant details such as the location, description, and any supporting evidence.
Election Overview: Users can view upcoming or ongoing elections in their region and stay informed about election details.
File Upload: Citizens can upload images, videos, or other files as evidence to support their claims.
Admin Management: Admins can view, moderate, and manage submitted reports to ensure the quality of data collected.
Responsive Design: The app is designed to work on all devices, ensuring users can submit reports from anywhere.
Potential Enhancements
Data Visualization: Display real-time data and reports using interactive maps or charts.
Notifications: Implement notifications to alert users of new reports in specific regions.
Search & Filter: Allow users to filter reports based on election, location, or severity of the issue.
Anonymous Reporting: Support anonymous submissions to encourage whistleblowers and prevent fear of retaliation.
